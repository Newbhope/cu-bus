An Android bus app for the Champaign-Urbana area!

Originally created during the summer of 2016. Had to delete and resubmit the project on GitHub sadly, but it should be up here for awhile.

Any Android developers, feel free to reference this project and use it. 

I wouldn't really enjoy if someone put no effort into a clone and published it to the play store, but I can't stop anyone with the MIT license.
